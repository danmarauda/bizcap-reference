# Bizcap Event Stack Reference

This repository is a **local reference hub** for the Bizcap Event Scoping system.

It is intentionally separate from the main application repo so agents and humans can:

- Clone upstream reference codebases.
- Keep a curated index of official documentation links.
- Store small, high-signal local notes about the stack.

## Layout

- `repos/` – local clones of upstream repositories (read-only reference).
- `docs/stack/` – curated notes and link indexes for each technology in the stack.

> Note: This repo should not contain secrets or proprietary customer data. It is for public OSS references and documentation summaries only.
